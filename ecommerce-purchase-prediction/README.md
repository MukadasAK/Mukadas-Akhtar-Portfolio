# From Code to Conversion: Analyzing Clickstream Data through Predictive Machine Learning and Website Design Efficiency in E-Commerce
**Description:**  
Developed a machine learning classification model to predict e-commerce purchases using session attributes. The project explores both interpretable models and non-linear approaches to provide insights for data-driven marketing.

**Goal:**  
To build and compare various classification models (such as logistic regression, SVM, and decision trees) to accurately predict purchase behavior, thereby enhancing targeted marketing strategies.

**Skills:**  
Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis, Model Evaluation, Data Visualization

**Technology:**  
Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees
