# Uncovering Allergens In Perfumes with Annotation And Machine Learning using Web Scraping

[Code for Perfume Allergens Analysis ](Web_scraping_code.ipynb)

**Description:**  
Conducted web scraping to integrate data from multiple sources and performed data annotation to structure the dataset. Developed a machine learning model leveraging word embeddings to predict perfume prices based on allergen analysis.

**Goal:**  
To transform unstructured data into a structured format and build a robust model that accurately predicts perfume prices through allergen analysis.

**Skills:**  
Web Scraping, Data Annotation, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning

**Technology:**  
Python, Web Scraping Libraries, NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy), Machine Learning Frameworks

**Results:**  
Successfully integrated diverse data sources and developed a price prediction model with promising accuracy, demonstrating the potential for scalable analysis in the beauty industry.
